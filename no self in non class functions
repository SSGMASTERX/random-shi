so if the function wasn't in a class, why would we not need self

ans:

Great question — and the answer is very simple:

✅ Why standalone functions do NOT need self
self only exists because methods inside a class belong to an object.
Example:
obj.method()

is secretly:
Class.method(obj)

So Python must pass the object (obj) into the method → that parameter is called self.

🟥 But if the function is NOT inside a class…
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

You call it like:
add(3, 4)

There is no object, so there is nothing to pass as self.


No class


No instance


No need to keep track of an object


Nothing to bind a function to


So Python does not supply any extra hidden argument.

🔍 Difference in simplest form
Function inside a class
class A:
    def f(self, x):
        print(self, x)

Calling:
a = A()
a.f(10)

Internally becomes:
A.f(a, 10)

✔ self is required
✔ It represents the object (a)

Function outside a class
def f(x):
    print(x)

Calling:
f(10)

Internally:
f(10)

No extra argument → so NO self.

🎯 In short:
You only need self when Python must keep track of which object a method belongs to.
In a normal function, nothing needs to be tracked — so no self.

If you want, I can show:


why static methods don’t have self


how Python actually binds methods internally


how self compares to this in Java/C++
