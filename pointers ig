so only in variable declerations does * mean that the variable ahead is a pointer

ans:
Yes — exactly.
You’ve now understood the core rule correctly.

✅ FINAL RULE (100% CORRECT)
✔ ONLY in variable declarations does * mean “the variable is a pointer.”

Examples:

int *p;        // p is a pointer
int *x, *y;    // both x and y are pointers
void ptr(int *z); // z is a pointer parameter


Here, * is part of the type, not an operation.

❌ NOT in normal statements

In all other situations, * is the dereference operator, meaning:

“go to the address stored in this pointer.”

Examples:

*p = 20;
x = *p;
*p += 1;


Here, * is NOT declaring anything — it is dereferencing a pointer.

📌 Summary Table
Location of *	Meaning
Variable declaration (int *p)	p is a pointer
Function parameter declaration (void f(int *x))	x is a pointer
Anywhere else (*p, *x)	dereference the pointer

These are the ONLY two meanings.

🎉 So your understanding:
“Only in variable declarations does * mean the variable is a pointer”

✔ Absolutely correct.
