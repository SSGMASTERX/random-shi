In python, 
class X:
    def f(this):
        print(this)
when obj = x()
      obj.f()
is passed, internally it's passed as x.f(obj), ie. as the first argument to signify which object the function is working on. This can also be other name and not necessarily self.
It signifies:
which object's attributes to read

which object's attributes to modify

which instance you’re calling the method on


so basically self here works as the parameter to take the instance name.
