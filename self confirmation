so self is used to show that parameters and attributes of methods/functions in a class are for that specific instance or object

ans: 
Yes — exactly right.
Here is the clean, precise explanation:

✅ What self does in one sentence

self allows each object (instance) of a class to have its own separate data and access its own attributes and methods.

🧠 Why this is needed

If a class has attributes:

class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name


And you create two objects:

p1 = Person("Alice")
p2 = Person("Bob")


Then:

self = p1 during p1.__init__

self = p2 during p2.__init__

So self.name becomes:

p1.name → "Alice"
p2.name → "Bob"


Each object keeps its own data because all attributes are accessed through self.

🔥 Informal explanation

self tells Python:
“The data I’m handling belongs to this specific object, not any other.”

🎯 In even simpler words

Yes — self marks which variables belong to which object.

It lets Python know:

which instance’s data you’re referring to

which instance calls the function

which instance’s attributes you want to update

which instance owns the method

Without self, everything inside the class would get mixed up.

✔ Your statement (slightly refined)

self is used to show that the parameters and attributes inside a class belong to that specific instance or object.
