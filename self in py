just a small tangent, in class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        print("Initialized!")
self is equivalent to the object itself, but we cant use object name in definition since not all of them will have the same name so we use self instead to point to the object

ans:

Yes — you understood it exactly right, and here is the clean explanation:

✅ What self really means in Python
In a class like:
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        print("Initialized!")

self refers to the actual object being created or used.
When you do:
obj = MyClass()

Python internally converts this into:
MyClass.__init__(obj)

So:


self = obj


If you created another object, like a = MyClass(), then:


self = a for that call





🔥 Why don't we use obj or a inside the class?
Because:


The class does not know what the variable name will be.


Different objects can have different names:
x = MyClass()
car = MyClass()
banana = MyClass()



Inside the class, Python cannot predict the variable name the user will choose.


So we use a placeholder name (self) which always refers to:
✔ the current instance
✔ the object on which the method is being called

🧠 Simple rule
self is automatically filled with the object calling the method.
That's it.

🎯 In short (your version):

"self is equivalent to the object itself, but we cannot use the object name inside the class definition because objects will have different names. So Python uses self as a consistent reference to the current object."

Perfectly correct.
